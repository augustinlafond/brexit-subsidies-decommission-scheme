# Analysis of ship dismantling subsidies in the context of Brexit

This repository contains the code and the data used to produce the analysis published by [BLOOM](https://www.bloomassociation.org) on the allocation of French public aid to the fisheries sector under the **Plan d'Accompagnement Individuel (PAI)**, set up to compensate shipowners affected by the Brexit. This fleet exit plan, backed by 58 million euros, financed the dismantling of 86 fishing vessels in 2023.

## üìä Data used

The project is based on an unprecedented cross-referencing of several data sources :

- List of PAI beneficiaries** (source: Secr√©tariat d'Etat charg√© de la mer)
- AIS vessel trajectories** for analysis of fishing grounds and pre-dismantling behavior (source: Global Fishing Watch platform)
- Distribution of fishing quotas before and after Brexit** (source: European Regulations)
- Information on vessels, home ports and technical characteristics** (source: Community Fleet Register)

## Executive summary :

The Brexit has plunged the fishing industry into a deep crisis, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and soaring energy prices due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, highlighting the structural vulnerability of much of the sector. In the face of these crises, public authorities have systematically opted for massive subsidies to preserve social peace. The Plan d'Accompagnement Individuel (PAI), with its 58 million euros in compensation for shipowners affected by the Brexit in exchange for dismantling their vessels, is part of this logic. In this groundbreaking report, BLOOM lifts the veil on the way in which the French administration designed and implemented this scheme, paving the way for abuses, inequalities and bypasses that profoundly question the coherence and legitimacy of public action in allocating subsidies.

- Dismantling aids: ‚Äúambiguous‚Äù subsidies 

For over thirty years, public subsidies for fishing have been dominated by decommissioning aid. Described as ‚Äúambiguous‚Äù by the scientific community, they can have positive or negative effects on the marine environment, depending on how they are implemented. In view of the considerable controversy surrounding these subsidies, and their high cost to the public purse - ‚Ç¨58 million for the dismantling of 86 ships under the PAI program - it seems more necessary than ever to question their real effectiveness.

- Semi-industrial and industrial vessels in the firing line of the fleet exit plan

The majority of these subsidies have targeted the destruction of semi-industrial and industrial vessels - boats measuring between 12 and 46 meters - which use destructive fishing gear such as trawls or seines, with over 41 million euros earmarked for some 50 vessels. This targeting is a first step towards supporting the sector's social and ecological transition, by reducing the activity of the most destructive fleet segments.

- The French administration has deliberately extended access to subsidies to vessels unaffected by the Brexit, in defiance of the plan's original objective.

To qualify for subsidies, shipowners had to prove that their catches were dependent on British waters (geographical dependence criterion) or on a certain number of stocks shared with the UK (stock dependence criterion). The latter criterion is justified because some vessels were affected by the Brexit, not because of their fishing zone, but because the UK recovered a share of the fishing quotas initially allocated to EU vessels. But the major problem is this: some 30 species on the list of stocks eligible for aid actually suffered no loss of quota, and many others were only marginally impacted. By knowingly broadening the eligibility criteria, the French administration has enabled vessels not impacted by the Brexit to benefit from public aid, to the detriment of the scheme's original objectives. 

- Subsidies captured by manufacturers: when dismantling benefits the most powerful

An analysis of the beneficiaries reveals that just a dozen fishing companies, representing 16% of the total number of companies, received almost 28.3 million euros, or half of the subsidies. At the top of the list, Scap√™che, the Les Mousquetaires group fleet that supplies certain supermarkets including Intermarch√©, received nearly 11 million euros, or 19% of all subsidies. Three of the seven vessels dismantled with public money had been fishing in deep waters for years, despite scientific advice, before this practice of massive destruction of the seabed was finally banned. The holding company La Houle, owner of 14 subsidiaries and 10 vessels, 4 of which benefited from the PAI, received nearly 3.9 million euros. The access of these large companies to the subsidies was made possible by an a posteriori modification of the decree defining the conditions of eligibility, obviously under pressure from the industrial fishing lobbies.  

- Subsidies distributed profoundly inequitably between regions

Brittany, the main bastion of industrial fishing, has captured 60% of the total budget for the Fleet Exit Plan, i.e. nearly 36 million euros, while regions equally exposed to the consequences of Brexit, such as Hauts-de-France, have been vastly under-allocated. The imbalance becomes even more glaring when we relate these amounts to the size of regional fleets. Brittany received almost three times more subsidies per unit of capacity than Hauts-de-France. This distribution raises questions, all the more so as shipowners from Boulogne-sur-Mer, whose 60% of sales depended on British waters, were unjustifiably excluded from the scheme, despite their critical situation. These vessels operate in an area where the narrow geography of the Channel severely limits fishing alternatives. They should therefore have been fully eligible under the geographical dependence criterion.

- A major windfall effect 

To benefit from the PAI, shipowners were required not to invest in a new vessel for five years. But it seems that the amount of the subsidies - much higher than the resale price of the vessels - was too attractive: some shipowners circumvented the restrictions by anticipating the scheme and increasing their fishing capacity before the CIP was introduced. This is the case, for example, of La Houle, which openly advertises its fleet renewal strategy in the press, in total contradiction with the IPOA's objective of reducing the number of active vessels. Other shipowners have not hesitated to set up a legally separate company, so as not to be constrained by these regulations and to have a free hand to invest. 

- A unique opportunity to reallocate quotas

Finally, the question of the effectiveness of the exit plan is inextricably linked to the question of the redistribution of fishing rights. Following an exit plan, 70% of the fishing rights of decommissioned vessels are allocated to the reserves of producer organizations, and 30% to a national reserve managed by the Directorate General for Maritime Affairs, Fisheries and Aquaculture (DGAMPA). In view of the exceptional amount of money that this fleet exit plan represents, it is crucial that producer organizations and the administration reallocate as much of this surplus as possible to small coastal vessels, in order to really kick-start the sector's social and ecological transition.
